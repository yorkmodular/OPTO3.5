# York Modular OptoThing-3.5

What you'll find here - various panel design files for York Modular Eurorack modules.
These files are provided AS-IS with absolutely no warranty - use 'em at your own risk etc.etc.

A number of file types are provided:

- **optokit-4hp.dxf** - Blank (unlettered) panel file in AutoCAD format. This is probably what you want if you're sending the panels off to be cut by a third party.
- **optokit-4hp.fpd** - Panel file for Schaeffer's Front Panel Designer software. Use this as a base for customisation _or_ if you plan to have your panels fabbed by Schaeffer themselves.
- **optothing-schematic-OLD.png** - the old version of the schematic. Left here for posterity - you probably don't want to refer to this.
- **optothing-schematic.png** - the updated schematic. Work from this, instead.
- **optothing-v3-OLD.xlsx** - Bill of Materials (BOM) in Excel format. For old modules only.
- **optothing-v3.5.stl** - STL file for 3D printing
